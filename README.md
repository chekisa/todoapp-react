# Third project of "Code Of Month" 2
I used React.js in the construction of this website. I used React.js-i for the first time in this project. I have created a card for "Todo App" by adding styles with css and users will be able to add their to-do actions there. moreover, they will be able to update and delete their added to-dos. The actions added by the users are stored in the local storage, so even when the page is refreshed, the actions they have written remain on the page.
